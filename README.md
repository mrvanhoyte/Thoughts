# Thoughts
A simple app to log my thoughts as I go through the day into notion using notion api integration.
### Getting Started
1. To get started you will first need to update the ENV file with api keys and database ID   

2. Once that is complete run this project on your localhost you will use:
``
nvm run devStart
``

3. got to http://localhost:3000/

4. Thats it.
